## 5. WORKFLOWS

Go to: **Automation → Workflows → Create Workflow**

**Folder:** `04. Mastermind Webinar`

> Create all workflows in this folder to keep them organized.

---

### WORKFLOW 1: New Registration

**Name:** `Masterclass 0226 - New Registration`

**Trigger:** Tag Added → `Masterclass 0226 - Registered`

> The Vercel API creates the contact and adds this tag via GHL API. When the tag is added, this workflow fires.

**Single Flow Structure (Step-by-Step in GHL):**

**Trigger:** Tag Added → `Masterclass 0226 - Registered`

> **Important:** NO confirmation email is sent here. The confirmation is sent by:
> - Purchasing VIP → VIP Welcome email (Workflow 2)
> - Clicking "No thanks" → Confirmation email (Workflow 3)
> - Not clicking either → Auto-confirmed as free after 10 min (Workflow 3)

---

2. Pipeline: `Masterclass 0226 - Registration`
3. Stage: `New Registration`

**Action 2: Condition (Add Date-Specific Tag + Auto-Confirm Check)**

> In GHL, actions after a condition must go inside branches. So we add the date tag, wait, and check inside each branch.
>
> **Important:** If user doesn't click VIP or "No thanks", they still get the free registration after 10 minutes. This ensures non-tech-savvy users don't miss out.

---

## 8. CONNECTING YOUR CUSTOM LANDING PAGE

Your Vercel API creates the contact in GHL and adds the registration tag. When the tag is added, Workflow 1 triggers automatically.

### Step 1: Get Your GHL API Key

1. Go to **Settings → Business Profile → API Keys**
2. Create a new API key or copy existing one
3. Save it as an environment variable in Vercel: `GHL_API_KEY`

### Step 2: Get Your GHL Location ID

1. Go to **Settings → Business Profile**
2. Copy your Location ID
3. Save it as an environment variable in Vercel: `GHL_LOCATION_ID`

### Step 3: Update Your Vercel API (`/api/register`)

```javascript
// In your /api/register endpoint:

const GHL_API_KEY = process.env.GHL_API_KEY;
const GHL_LOCATION_ID = process.env.GHL_LOCATION_ID;

// Step 1: Create or update contact
const contactResponse = await fetch('https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/contacts/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${GHL_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Version': '2021-07-28'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    locationId: GHL_LOCATION_ID,
    firstName: data.firstName,
    lastName: data.lastName,
    email: data.email,
    phone: data.phone,
    customFields: [
      {
        key: 'masterclass_0226__date',
        field_value: data.webinarDate  // "Feb 16, 2026" or "Feb 18, 2026"
      }
    ],
    tags: ['Masterclass 0226 - Registered']  // This triggers Workflow 1
  })
});

const contact = await contactResponse.json();
console.log('Contact created:', contact.contact.id);
```

### How It Works

1. User submits registration form on your landing page
2. Vercel API creates contact in GHL with the `Masterclass 0226 - Registered` tag
3. GHL detects the tag was added → triggers **Workflow 1: New Registration**
4. Workflow sends confirmation email, SMS, adds to pipeline, etc.

### Alternative: Using GHL REST API v1 (Simpler)

```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/contacts/', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${GHL_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    firstName: data.firstName,
    lastName: data.lastName,
    email: data.email,
    phone: data.phone,
    tags: ['Masterclass 0226 - Registered'],
    customField: {
      masterclass_0226__date: data.webinarDate
    }
  })
});
```

---

## 9. UPGRADE PAGE INTEGRATION

Your upgrade page (`upgrade.html`) triggers tags via the Vercel API.

**VIP Checkout URL:** `https://webinar.maxxedout.com/vip-checkout`

**When "Yes! Upgrade Me to VIP" is clicked:**
- Opens GHL checkout in an iframe modal
- Autofills: `full_name`, `email`, `phone` from URL params
- After payment, GHL triggers Workflow 2 automatically

**When "No thanks" is clicked:**
- The `upgrade.html` page calls `/api/free-confirm` which adds the `Masterclass 0226 - Free Confirmed` tag
- This triggers Workflow 3, which sends the confirmation email

**Vercel API Endpoint:** `/api/free-confirm.js`

```javascript
// This endpoint is called when user clicks "No thanks, continue with free registration"
// It finds the contact by email and adds the "Masterclass 0226 - Free Confirmed" tag

POST /api/free-confirm
Body: { "email": "user@example.com" }

// The tag triggers Workflow 3 which:
// 1. Moves contact to "Free Confirmed" pipeline stage
// 2. Sends the confirmation email
// 3. Sends the qualifying SMS
```

**upgrade.html skip button code (already implemented):**

```javascript
document.getElementById('skip-upgrade').addEventListener('click', async function() {
    const btn = this;
    btn.disabled = true;
    btn.textContent = 'Processing...';

    try {
        // Call API to add "Free Confirmed" tag to the contact
        await fetch('/api/free-confirm', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ email: email })
        });
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error confirming free registration:', error);
    }

    // Redirect to confirmation page
    window.location.href = '/confirmation' + queryString;
});
```

## QUICK REFERENCE: TAG LOGIC

**How to identify a VIP for a specific date:**
- Feb 16 VIP = Has tag `Masterclass 0226 - VIP - Feb 16`
- Feb 18 VIP = Has tag `Masterclass 0226 - VIP - Feb 18`
- Any VIP = Tag contains `Masterclass 0226 - VIP`

**How to identify registrants by date:**
- Feb 16 registrants = Has tag `Masterclass 0226 - Feb 16`
- Feb 18 registrants = Has tag `Masterclass 0226 - Feb 18`

**This prevents confusion because:**
1. All tags start with `Masterclass 0226` - clearly identifies the event
2. VIP tags include the date - you know exactly which session they upgraded for
3. Won't conflict with tags from other events (e.g., `Dallas Event - VIP`)
