Webinar Strategy Notes
Meeting with Rafael G

================================================================================
LEAD GENERATION & ADS
================================================================================

- Run ads 10-14 days out from the webinar
- Ad creative must reflect the landing page messaging
- Landing page: Todd covers something very specific
- Ad should preview: "Inside this webinar you'll learn X, Y, Z"

Meta Ads Strategy:
- Use Ad Library to research competitors
- Look for ads running 3-4 months = proven winners
- Study what's working and model the approach
- Same strategy applies for Google Ads

================================================================================
SPLASH PAGE / CONFIRMATION PAGE
================================================================================

- Add testimonial video on the next page (confirmation/thank you)
- Calendar integration: New tool allows registrants to add event directly to their calendar
- Automated reminder system built in
- Zoom registration = 100% deliverability on reminders

Pro Tip: 10-15 minutes before going live, rename the Zoom event to something attention-grabbing
(e.g., "STARTING NOW - Join Todd Live!") to trigger notifications to all attendees

================================================================================
OPT-IN AUTOMATION
================================================================================

1. Immediately after signup:
   - Send confirmation: "Thanks for signing up"
   - Include Zoom link
   - Ask qualifying question: "What do you want to improve on?"

2. Have someone text back immediately (setters)

3. Reminder sequence:
   - 72 hours before
   - 24 hours before
   - 1 hour before

================================================================================
DURING THE WEBINAR
================================================================================
